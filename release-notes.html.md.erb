**Release Date: March 29, 2019**

### Features
   
New features and changes in this release:

* Adds Slow Consumers chart on the Logging Performance page that graphs the `doppler_proxy.slow_consumer` metric. For more information about the Slow Consumer Drops KPI, see [Slow Consumer Drops](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#slow-consumer).
* Replaces Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate chart on the Logging Performance page with a Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages chart that graphs the `rlp.dropped, direction: egress` metric. For more information about the Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages KPI, see [Reverse Log Proxy Egress Dropped Messages](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#rlp-egress-dropped).
* Adds Log Cache Cache Duration chart on the Logging Performance page that graphs the `log_cache.cache_period` metric. For more information about the Log Cache Cache Duration KPI, see [Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#cache-duration).
* Updates Syslog Drain Binding Capacity chart on the Logging Performance page to calculate using the `cf-syslog-drain.adapter.drain_bindings` metric instead of the `cf-syslog-drain.scheduler.drains` metric. For more information about the CF Syslog Drain Bindings Count KSI, see [CF Syslog Drain Bindings Count](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#scalable-syslog-ksi).
* Delete alert configurations with HAPI. For more information, see [Configuring PCF Healthwatch Alerts](./api/alerts.html).
* Displays banner on Healthwatch dashboard when Redis queue size reaches a Critical state and Healthwatch may not be able to evaluate the health of the foundation. 
* Improves log output when `bosh-health-check` deployment creation or deletion fails.
* Updates default threshold of `locket.ActiveLocks` alert configuration from 4 to 5.
* Updates Bosh CLI to v5.4.0.
* Updates Loggregator Agent to v3.0.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.
   
#### Active Locks Alert Threshold Changes When PAS Feature Disabled

**Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments** is an optional configuration in PAS v2.4 that changes the recommended alert threshold of the Active Locks KPI from `5` to `4`. For more information about the Active Locks KPI, see [Active Locks](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#ActiveLocks).

This configuration is in the **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile. The corresponding manifest property is `advanced_features.properties.cloud_controller_temporary_disable_deployments`.

If you select **Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments** in the PAS tile, use the PCF Healthwatch API to update the alert threshold for active locks to a value of `4`. To do this, send the following API call:
    
```
"{\"query\":\"origin == 'locket' and name == 'ActiveLocks'\",\"threshold\":{\"critical\":4,\"type\":\"EQUALITY\"}}"
```

For more information, see [Update Alert Configurations](./api/alerts.html#post). 

#### Action Required when Changing Metrics Deployment Name in PAS Tile

PAS v2.4 introduces the ability to uniquely identify metrics by tile. It uses `cf-GUID` as the value for `deployment`, which matches the BOSH deployment name. In PAS v2.3 and earlier, metrics have a `deployment` value of `cf`. The **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile includes a **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** checkbox to override this new feature and revert to previous behavior.

If you change the value of the **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** checkbox in the PAS v2.4 tile, you must run the Healthwatch **Push Monitoring Components** errand. Healthwatch does not detect the change in PAS configuration unless you run this errand. 

For 24 hours after the configuration change, Healthwatch handles metric data in the following ways:

* Data emitted with the previous `cf` tag is treated as an Isolation Segment. 
* Data emitted with the new `cf-GUID` tag is treated as the default CF deployment.

During this window, use the Isolation Segment dropdown on the **Capacity** and **Routing** detail pages to view the data from before the configuration change. You can toggle between `cf` and `cf-GUID`.

For more information, see the [PAS 2.4 release notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#metrics-prefix).

#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the application `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2, which is in lock with vSAN, leave behind a namespace or folder and subfolders when the VM is deleted. The orphaned folders cause the vSAN object count to increase. This is a known issue for vSAN. For more information about the vSAN known issue, see [Deleted VMs leave components behind](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/issues/165) in GitHub.

To address the issue, you can update vSphere to v6.5 update 2 and later. If updating vSphere is not an option, stop the `bosh-health-check` to slow down the increase in vSAN object count.

#### Healthwatch Periodically Registers a False Drop In Diego Cell Capacity

Healthwatch ingests metrics from Diego once per minute. Occasionally, Diego emits metrics to Healthwatch outside of the minute window. This causes Healthwatch to register a false drop in the Diego Cell Capacity metric.

If the drop in Diego Cell Capacity is not longer than one minute, it does not represent a true drop in Diego Cell Capacity and can be disregarded.

#### <a id='indicator'></a>Tiles without BPM cannot be installed with Indicator Protocol Enabled

When customers check the radio button to enable indicator protocol and attempt to redeploy a tile that does not include the BPM job on all of its VMs, the deployment will fail when updating runtime configs during the next apply changes. Here is an example of the error failing for mysql:
```

```

(It suggests reviewing the logs for indicator-registration-agent, but there are no logs in the `/var/vcap/sys/log/indicator-registration-agent` directory of the failing Bosh VM.)

The radio button in question can be found here:

<%= image_tag './images/healthwatch-opsman-config.png' %>

This is caused because the BPM release and job are not included in the runtime config used to enable Indicator Protocol.

The registration agent depends on BPM to schedule the scraping of the file system for indicator documents.

The only known workaround is not to enable Indicator Protocol, or to disable it.
